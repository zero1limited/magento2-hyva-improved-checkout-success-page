# Magento 2 - Improved Checkout Success Page

For Magento 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x and 2.4.x

## Benefits

The checkout success page is the final step in the customers journey on your site. It's very easy to lose sight of the checkout success page and it may seem like it's one of the least important parts of the customer's journey, but it's actually very important. It’s make or break when it comes to turning first-time shoppers into occasional and loyal customers.

Imagine inviting a friend over at your house on a Friday night. You make sure your house is warm & inviting, and you have a lovely sit down meal over some great conversation. You spend the night having a great time...
Then, just when it’s time for your friend to leave, you suddenly disappear. You expect him/her to find their own way out, and close the door behind themselves. 
No matter how great of an evening you've both had, they probably won’t be coming over again any time soon...
Now imagine that same scenario, but instead of disappearing you politely see your friend out. You tell them what a great time you had, and that you would love to get together again soon. Sounds much better than the first scenario doesn’t it?

This is exactly what we should be doing with your online customers at the checkout success page to convince them to come back for more.

A lot of time, effort and money is spent aquiring new customers, but it's easy to forget that customer retention is most profitable. In fact, your revenue would double if only 10% more of your current customers came back for a second purchase!

Out of the box, Magento's checkout success page is poor, but with this module you'll be able to gain all of the benefits and features, for free!
